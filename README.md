## Methods

* kNN - different variation of the kNN algorithm were tryed out. Various distance metrics and values for k were used to obtain the best result.
* Classification tree
* Naive Bayes 


## Results

* kNN - best result of % was obtained for k = 1 using the Manhate
* Classification tree - 88.
* Naive Bayes -
